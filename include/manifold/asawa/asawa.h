Ruth Aiko Asawa (January 24, 1926 â€“ August 5, 2013) was an American modernist
sculptor. Her work is featured in collections at the Solomon R. Guggenheim
Museum and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City.[1] Fifteen of
Asawa's wire sculptures are on permanent display in the tower of San Francisco's
de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park, and several of her fountains are located in
public places in San Francisco.[2] She was an arts education advocate and the
driving force behind the creation of the San Francisco School of the Arts, which
was renamed the Ruth Asawa San Francisco School of the Arts in 2010.[3] In 2020,
the U.S. Postal Service honored her work by producing a series of ten stamps
that commemorate her well-known wire sculptures.[4][5]
